# Compiling
to compile a new version of code with multi-threading,you will need use a moc,compile it but with final moc file looking the exact same like this: "moc_multithreaded_with_settings_main.cpp" , after getting a moc file you can compile it with gcc.

# P.S
This code were written fully by LLMs
Eg: ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Deepseek
